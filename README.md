# BASE
Readme for BASE

Purpose of this program is to use user generated console input to convert numbers or sequences of numbers from one base to another. 

Available functions:
1 - Convert from X base to base 10 : With X base being determined by user input

2 - Convert from base ten to X base: With X base again being determined by user input

3 - Convert from X base to X base: With X base again being determined by user input

4 - Convert from Decimal to binary: A simple shortcut that converts a number sequence from base 10 to base 2

Planned/Optional (May add may not add)

5 - Convert from Binary to Decimal: Inverse of function #4

Given the simplistic nature of the program I don't expect to sell this, therefore everyone/anyone has my consent to modify/change/improve this source code. And if you can even sell it to someone, props to you my friend, as this was simply a stepping stone to me improving my skill with c++
